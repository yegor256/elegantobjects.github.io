        If you truly love OOP and agree with the premises of
        Elegant Objects, you must be in our gang. Want to join
        but don't know any member yet?
        Text <a href="https://t.me/yegor256">@yegor256</a> in Telegram.
        If you don't follow the rules listed here, you will be ejected.
      </p>
      <p>
        1. Each member must publish an article or give a speech
        about OOP once a month.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. Each published article must reference at least one
        article of another member, otherwise it doesn't count.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. Each member must react to each published article in its
        public comment section and everywhere, where it is cross-posted,
        including Twitter, Facebook, Hacker News, and Reddit.
        Also, shares and re-tweets are very desirable.
      </p>
      <p>
        4. By the end of the month a Secretary writes up a summary
        of members' activity, suggests new members, and recommends
        who to eject. The Secretary is a volunteer role.
      </p>
      <p>
        5. To join us a new member must submit a request to the
        Secretary, who will present the candidate for a democratic vote.
        A new member joins in with 51% of votes.
      </p>
      <p>
        6. A member can be ejected by 64% of votes.
